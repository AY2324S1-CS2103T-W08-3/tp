## Project: SteveJobs++
SteveJobs++ (SJ++) is a desktop app for managing job applications and contacts, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
SJ++ can help you manage tracking your job applications and contacts in a more streamlined fashion.
