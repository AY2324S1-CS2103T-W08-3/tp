INSERT INTRO TO JOBBY HERE
**Jobby** is a **desktop app for managing job applications and contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Jobby can help you manage tracking your job applications and contacts in a more streamlined fashion. If you can type fast, Jobby can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Command documentation

### Locating contacts by name and id: `find`

Current: Finds contacts whose names contain any of the given keywords or ids.

Format: `find KEYWORD/ID...`

* Name & ID are searched
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* You can match partial keywords. e.g. searching for `ha` will match with `hamburger`.
* Partial IDs can match the entire ID. e.g. searching for `1234` will match with `id_12345`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search)
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* Can match with multiple ids `12345 id_51231` will match with `id_12345` and `id_51231`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find id_12345` returns `john` and whose id is `id_12345`
* `find Jo` returns `john`, `John Doe`, `Josh` and every other keyword with `jo` in its substring
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
