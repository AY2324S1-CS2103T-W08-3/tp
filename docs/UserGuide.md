INSERT INTRO TO JOBBY HERE
**Jobby** is a **desktop app for managing job applications and contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Jobby can help you manage tracking your job applications and contacts in a more streamlined fashion. If you can type fast, Jobby can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Jobby Application.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar jobby.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

## Using Jobby

This section explains how we can understand and input commands in the app, like formatting and autocomplete.

If you're looking for the list of available commands, check out the [Features](#features) section instead.

### Command Structure

In Jobby, we write commands in the command box at the top of Jobby's window.

Commands are made up of a few parts: The **command**, **parameter names** and **input values**.

A command like "`edit google --name Google SG --id google-sg`" would refer to:
* the command `edit`,
* with a command value `google`,
* with a parameter `--name`,
  * which has the parameter value `Google SG`,
* with a parameter `--id`,
  * which has the parameter value `google-sg`.

Parameters may be in any order, whose names are of the form `-a` or `--abc123`, and must be surrounded by whitespace.

Any extra parameters and values to commands that don't accept them will either be ignored or throw an error.

**:bulb: Advanced tips:**<br>

* Parameter names are restricted to the `-`/`--` prefix, contain only letters and numbers, and must begin with a letter.

  * Any terms not following this format will be treated as data input, so an input like *"-5 degrees"* will work.

* Although Jobby's syntax resembles the usual Unix syntax, you should not quote your text, and you should not leave a trailing `=`.

</div>

### Command Explanations

Throughout this guide, you will find symbols and placeholders used to describe a command format. They are:

* **Words in `UPPER_CASE`**

  * The parts where you should be typing your parameter values.

  * e.g., `--name NAME` means inputting names along the lines of `--name Alice`.

* **Terms separated by `/` or `|`**

  * Exactly one of the given options.

  * These may be included in the parameter names or value description.

  * e.g., `--a/--b` means either `--a` or `--b` but not `--a --b`.

* **Terms surrounded by `[` and `]`**

  * An optional parameter or option that may be omitted.

* **Terms ending with `...`**

  * The parameter is multivalued.

  * e.g., `[--tag TAG]...` means `--tag` and its value can be repeated from 0 to any number of times.

### Command Autocomplete

Command autocompletion allows you to type commands in Jobby at unimaginable speeds.

As you type your command, you may see a list of suggested completions pop up.
Just press **TAB** or **SPACE** to select the first suggestion to fill in that text!

To temporarily hide all suggestions, press **ESC**. This temporarily disables autocompletion for the next keystroke.

If suggestions were hidden or aren't shown when they should, press **TAB** to prompt Jobby to bring it back.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:bulb: Advanced tips:**<br>

* Autocomplete checks for fuzzy matches - it sorts by the best *subsequence* prefix match first.

  * For example, you can type `-nm` to get the autocompletion result of `--name`.

  * This allows you to quickly choose between parameter names with similar prefixes, e.g., by typing
    `-dsp` to select `--description` instead of `--descending`.

* If you rather choose from the list instead of typing out the prefix, it is possible to use the **UP** and **DOWN**
  arrow keys to navigate through the menu, then press **ENTER** to select them.

* Accidentally triggered autocomplete when you didn't intend to? Don't worry, just press **BACKSPACE** to immediately
  revert to your previously typed text.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:information_source: Limitations:**<br>

* Autocomplete is not autocorrect. It will not attempt to correct mistyped details.

* Autocomplete suggests plausible values you may want to add onto your partially typed command. It does not verify that the command will run.
