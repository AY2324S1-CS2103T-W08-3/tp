INSERT INTRO TO JOBBY HERE
**Jobby** is a **desktop app for managing job applications and contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Jobby can help you manage tracking your job applications and contacts in a more streamlined fashion. If you can type fast, Jobby can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
